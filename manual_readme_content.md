## Asset Configuration For Authentication

-   ERS uses HTTPS port 9060 which is closed by default. Clients trying to access this port without
    enabling ERS first will face a timeout from the server. Therefore, the first requirement is to
    enable ERS from the Cisco ISE admin UI. Go to Administration \> Settings \> ERS Settings and
    enable the Enable ERS for Read/Write radio button
-   Go to Administration \> System \> Admin Users. Now add an account by clicking Add \> Create an
    admin user. Then enter name and password and select ERS Admin in Admin Group and then press
    save.
-   Go to Administration \> System \> Admin Users. Now add an account by clicking Add \> Create an
    admin user. Then enter name and password and select MnT Admin in Admin Group and then press
    save.
-   Configurations expect user with MnT Admin Access group in username/password fields and user in
    ERS Admin group in ERS username/password fields or user with both MnT Admin or ERS Admin access
    group in username/password field.
-   Also, you can add both MnT Admin and ERS Admin Access groups to a user and use that credentials
    in username/password. The App will use username/password if ERS username/password is not
    provided

## Note

1.  The actions "quarantine system" and "unquarantine system" are removed in the version 3.0.0.
    Users are advised to use "apply policy" and "clear policy" actions to achieve the same objective
2.  ERS credentials are required for actions
    -   list endpoints
    -   get device info
    -   update device info
    -   get resources
    -   delete resource
    -   create resource
    -   update resource
    -   apply policy
    -   create policy
3.  An ISE node can assume any or all of the following personas: Administration, Policy Service, and
    Monitoring. For detailed info: [Types of
    nodes](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ise/1.0/user_guide/ise10_dis_deploy.html#wp1123452)
    -   All actions can run on Administration node.
    -   Actions create resource, update resource, delete resource, list resource, get resources,
        list sessions, update device info, get device info, and list endpoints can run on Monitoring
        node
    -   Actions quarantine device, unquarantine device, apply policy, clear policy, and terminate
        session can run on Policy Service node
4.  For create resource action, user needs to provide valid json with required fields of that
    specified resource (For more details head over to [API
    Reference](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/identity-services-engine/v1/#!endpoint) ). Examples
    as below
    -   Endpoint
